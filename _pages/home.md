# Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N)

Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N) is a data standard for neurophysiology, providing neuroscientists with a common standard to share, archive, use, and build common analysis tools for neurophysiology data. NWB:N is designed to store a variety of neurophysiology data, including from intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology experiments, optical physiology experiments, as well as tracking and stimulus data.

This page is used to collect and organize materials around the NWB:N data standard and ecosystem. For an overview of the NeurodataWithoutBorders project at large see also the <a href="https://www.nwb.org/">nwb.org</a> website.

## NWB:N -- An Ecosystem for Neuroscience Data Standardization

NWB:N is more than just a file format; it defines an ecosystem of tools, methods, and standards for
storing, sharing, and analyzing complex neurophysiology data. For more details, see the [Project Overview](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/overview).
