# Getting Started with NWB:N

## I am a scientist/developer in a neuroscience lab and want to start using NWB:N

Welcome! For end-users, the main entry point into the world of NWB:N is usually the PyNWB Python API. Have a look
at our  <a href="https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html"  target="_blank">tutorials</a>
and also see the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pynwb">PyNWB : Python Reference API documentation</a>
in general for more details.

For Matlab users, MatNWB also provides a Matlab API for NWB:N 2.0.  For more details, see the
MatNWB repository on <a href="https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/matnwb"  target="_blank">GitHub</a> or on <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/67741-neurodatawithoutborders-matnwb" target="_blank">FileExchange</a>.

## I am a developer and would like to contribute to NWB:N development

Welcome! Please see our  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contributing">Contributing Guidelines</a> and
<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</a> for further details. Also
have a look out for [good first issue](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and
[help wanted](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
issue tickets on GitHub.

## I want to get an overview of all the aspects of NWB:N

A general overview and pointers to all relevant documents are available as part of the
<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/overview">Project Overview</a> page. For a more broader overview
of the NeurodataWithoutBorders project at large, see also the
<a href="https://www.nwb.org/">nwb.org</a> website.
