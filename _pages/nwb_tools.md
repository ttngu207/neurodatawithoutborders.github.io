Brainstorm is a collaborative, open-source application dedicated to the analysis of brain recordings:
MEG, EEG, fNIRS, ECoG, depth electrodes and animal invasive neurophysiology built in Matlab. Brainstorm now supports the NWB
data format for importing ECoG and invasive electrophysiology data. The application povides a graphical interface for a preprocessing pipeline, including spike sorting using WavClus, UltraMegaSort2000, KiloSort or Klusters, a large large suite of LFP analyses, data visualization, and interactive 3D rendering of brains.
