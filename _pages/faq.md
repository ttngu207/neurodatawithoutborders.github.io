# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is NWB:N 2 stable?

Yes! NWB:N 2.0 was officially released in January 2019, and the schema is now stable. Any changes that will be made now will be backwards compatible.

## I would like to use NWB:N. How do I get started?

See the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/gettingstarted">Getting Started</a> page for more information.

## What is the difference between pynwb, nwb-schema and api-python?

**PyNWB** is the current Python reference read/write API for the NWB:N 2.x format.
The **nwb-schema** repo is used to manage development on the data standard schema. End-users
who want to use NWB:N typically do not need to worry about the **nwb-schema** repo
as the current schema is always installed with the corresponding API (whether it
is PyNWB for Python or MatNWB for Matlab). **api-python** is a deprecated write-only
API designed for NWB:N 1.0.x files. **PyNWB** also provides support for reading some
NWB:N 1.0.x files from popular data repositories, such as the
[Allen Cell Types Atlas](http://celltypes.brain-map.org/) via the
pynwb/legacy module.

## Does PyNWB support NWB:N 1.0.x files?

PyNWB includes the pynwb/legacy module
which supporta reading of NWB:N 1.0.x files from popular data repositories, such as the
[Allen Cell Types Atlas](http://celltypes.brain-map.org/) . For NWB:N 1.0.x files from other sources
the millage may vary in particular when files are not fully format compliant, e.g., include
arbitrary custom data or are missing required data fields.

## What has changed between NWB:N 1.0x and 2.0?

See the <a href="http://nwb-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_release_notes.html" target="_blank">release notes of the NWB:N format schema</a> for details about changes to the format schema. For details about changes to the specification language see the <a href="http://schema-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification_language_release_notes.html" targe="_blank">specification language release notes</a>. With reagrd to software, NWB:N 2 marks a full reboot and introduced with PyNWB, MatNWB, nwb-docutils, nwb-schema etc. several new packages and repositories while tools, e.g., api-python that were created for NWB:N 1.x have been deprectated. 

## How do I install PyNWB?

See the PyNWB documentation for details
